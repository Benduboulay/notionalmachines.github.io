title: Python Computer (Stage 1)
author: muehling
ProgrammingLanguage: Python (adaptable to others)
ProgrammingParadigm: imperative
ConceptualAdvantage: Expandable "offline" model of program execution. In its beginning stage, it only covers control flow and variables (without references) of Python scripts.
Form: Representation (hand-made)
DrawsAttentionTo: Semantics of control flow in Python. Visible effects of each line on the "state" of the Python computer.
UseWhen: At the beginning of a typical "walk through" of the different programming constructs.
Cost: Time consuming to prepare. Easy to follow for learners, as it grows in complexity. Can be used for exercises (fill out sheets of the computer).
OriginSource: Own practice

Mapping:
  Memory: "A table of identifer and value"
  Instruction: "Update of state according to defined rules"
  Variable: "Entry in the table"
  Conditional: "Conditional evaluator (flag) that affects the "program counter"
  "Control flow": "Program counter that identifies next line to get executed and is updated according to a set of rules."
