title: Recursion Demo with Python Tutor
author: craig
ProgrammingLanguage: Python
ProgrammingParadigm: imperative
ConceptualAdvantage: Demonstrates what happens to variable values when they are passed to a function. Distinguishes frame elements among each recursive call. Shows separate stack frames, each with own parameters and variables,
for each recursive call.
DrawsAttentionTo: Addition of each stack frame as each recursive call is made. Collapse of stack frame as function completes and returns value.
UseWhen: When introducing recursion
Cost: Requires use and understanding of the Python Tutor visualization tool

Mapping:
  frame: group of elements with function name
  parameter: labeled box inside frame
  "local variable": labeled box inside frame

<p>
    The following videos, used in Matthias Hauswirth's "Programming Fundamentals 2" Bachelor course, 
    use this notional machine to explain two specific control-flow constructs.

<h3>Notes from Interview/h3>
<p>
    This notional machine is used by Amber Settle. From the interview: 
    Students "tend to use it a little bit mechanically so they tend to just step through 
    it and not really think about what's actually happening on the screen."
