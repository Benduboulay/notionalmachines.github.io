title: Control Flow as Graph
author: matthias
ProgrammingLanguage: Java
ProgrammingParadigm: imperative
ConceptualAdvantage: Make visible the flow of computation through instructions to introduce the structured programming ideas of sequence, selection, and repetition
Form: Representation (hand-made)
DrawsAttentionTo: "The idea of a statement, a condition, and how they are used to build sequence, selection, and repetition constructs of structured programming"
UseWhen: When introducing control-flow constructs (conditionals and loops)
Cost: "Small, but e.g., mismatch for short-circuit operators (&&, ||) or conditional expressions (c ? a : b), which don't map as naturally."
OriginSource: "Compilers (control-flow graphs) and flow charts"
image: ControlFlowAsGraph.png
Mapping:
  statement: "rectangular node"
  condition: "diamond-shaped node"
  "control-flow between statements": "arrow from node to node"
  "condition outcomes": "label on an arrow coming out of a condition (e.g., true, false)"

    The following videos, used in Matthias Hauswirth's "Programming Fundamentals 2" Bachelor course, 
    use this notional machine to explain two specific control-flow constructs.
